# Gender Inequality Project
In this project I analyse World Bank data on Gender statistics to predict and
model the level of gender equality for 82 countries using machine learning models. I chose the
target variable ‘Female share of employment in senior and middle management (%)’ as an indicator
for gender equality.

This project was submitted as a final assignment for a Bootcamp in Ai and Machine Learning (Level 5) at Gateshead College, May to July 2025.
